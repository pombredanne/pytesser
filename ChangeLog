May 25, 2007 - V0.0.2
Enhancements:
* Upgraded to v1.04 of Tesseract OCR
* Whitespace stripped from end of output text.
Changes:
* Instead of tesseract.exe, uses tessdll.dll and dlltest-mod.exe (to expose Tesseract internals)
* External process now called with shell=True
* Now requires v1.1.6 or higher of PIL library
Bug fixes:
* Changing working directory no longer causes pytesser calls to fail
* Tesseract's output to stderr redirected so as not to print to screen 
[WARNING: for compatibility with IDEs such as PythonWin, a possible exception in the redirection is
caught in a not very elegant way]
* 'RGBA' mode image objects (and others causing same error) now converted to 'RGB' mode 
to properly save to disk
* Improvement to error catching in *nix.  
(Thanks to commenter Philip for code and suggestions fixing several bugs.)
